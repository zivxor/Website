    <h1>About Zivxor</h1>
    <p>No, Zivxor is not my name. If you do not already know my name, you probably do not need it.

I am just some Serbian kid obsessed with computers, building stuff that has no right working as well as it does. Coding is awesome, but it is not the only thing in my life.

Do calisthenics sometime... Your body will thank you. And fix your diet while you are at it; being a tech person does not mean you can escape this pysical world we live in.
